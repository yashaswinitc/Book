<h1>&nbsp;A book is both a usually portable physical object and the body of immaterial representations or intellectual object whose material signs—written or drawn lines or other two-dimensional media—the physical object contains or houses.</br> a number of pieces of paper, usually with words printed on them, which are fastened together and fixed inside a cover of stronger paper or cardboard. Books contain information, stories, or poetry, for example. His eighth book came out earlier this year and was an instant best-seller.
A similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events, information, and ideas is called a diary or personal journal. Businesses use accounting books such as journals and ledgers to record financial data in a practice called bookkeeping.
It needs an instrument, ie the writer who is uniquely appropriate for letting the story flow through him/her. I believe this is especially true of good books, fiction or non fiction. On the readers side, the purpose is whatever meaning the reader derives from the book.

<h1>&nbsp;A range of titles are available in used bookstores, including in print and out of print books. ... Individuals wishing to sell their used books using online bookstores agree to terms outlined by the bookstore(s): for example, paying the online bookstore(s) a predetermined commission once the books have sold.
A bookstore is a store that sells books, and where people can buy them. A used bookstore or second-hand bookshop sells and often buys used books.
Here he considers the subtle distinction between a "bookstore" and a "bookshop." Most ordinary kinds of stores and shops (e.g., grocery stores, auto body shops) do not have the dignity of a one-word designation. ... But while having two words is a luxury, it is not absolutely redundant<h1>

<h1>&nbsp;Even if you have read one good book in your life, you will know what reading gives. It gives you incomparable pleasure. While there is no doubt about the fact that reading is a priceless activity, it has been observed that the habit of reading has declined of late. One of the main causes for this decline is the growth of technology. However, what most people don’t know is there is so much to benefit from reading. Here are 30 reasons of reading books:
Reading improves your vocabulary and command on the language. As you read, you come across new words, idioms, new words, phrases and writing styles.Reading a well-written book affects your ability to become a better writer. Just like artists influence others, so do writers. Many successful authors gained their expertise by reading the works of others. So, if you want to become a better writer, start by learning from previous masters.

<h1>&nbsp;An author is the creator or originator of any written work such as a book or play, and is thus also a writer. More broadly defined, an author is "the person who originated or gave existence to anything" and whose authorship determines responsibility for what was created.<br/>Typically, the first owner of a copyright is the person who created the work i.e. the author. If more than one person created the work, then a case of joint authorship can be made provided some criteria are met. In the copyright laws of various jurisdictions, there is a necessity for little flexibility regarding what constitutes authorship. The United States Copyright Office, for example, defines copyright as "a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States (title 17, U.S. Code) to authors of "original works of authorship".[2] Holding the title of "author" over any "literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, [or] certain other intellectual works" gives rights to this person, the owner of the copyright, especially the exclusive right to engage in or authorize any production or distribution of their work. Any person or entity wishing to use intellectual property held under copyright must receive permission from the copyright holder to use this work, and often will be asked to pay for the use of copyrighted material.<h1>

<h1>&nbsp;All books are either nonfiction or fiction. Nonfiction books contain biographies and history books etc. Fiction books contain a story which was made by the author. 
Nonfiction 
Biographies are examples of nonfiction works. Most biographies are nonfiction, but not all nonfiction works. We say "most " biographies, because a biography of a fictional character is a really a fictional book. Journals such as The Diary of Anne Frank is also a journal but it is a nonfiction journal. Other examples of nonfiction books are "How to" books and travel books. 
Fiction 
The most commonly read works are fiction. Fiction books are ones that have been made up. Perhaps some of their elements are based on truths, but have elaborated, fabricated and used to embellish into a new story. 
Two types of can be further divided into many different sub types called "generes" of book which are:
Science Fiction, satire, drama, Action and Adventure, Romance, mystery, horror, self help, guide, travel, children's, religious, science, history, math, anthologies, poetry, encyclopedia, dictionaries, comics, art, cookbooks, diaries, prayer books, series, trilogies, biographies, autobiographies, and fantasy.
